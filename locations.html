<p style="text-align: center;"> 
	<br>At the easternmost tip of the Dominican Republic lie the beautiful beaches and azure waters of Punta Cana, which is served by an international airport. Year-round temperatures average 71 to 87 degrees in Punta Cana. A generous, 30-mile stretch of sand is divided into six separate beach areas that offer an array of activities, like kayaking, parasailing, glass-bottom boat rides, catamaran outings and horseback rides. Sportfishing is a favorite pastime here and, of course, you'll also find plenty of inviting beach chairs for lounging.

<br><br>Visitors can have up-close encounters with the local wildlife at Manati Park, inhabited by iguanas, flamingos, sea lions and dolphins. This attraction also is known for the showmanship of its magnificent "dancing horses." The Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea meet at Punta Cana, which makes diving conditions rough for beginners in scuba. But experienced divers can explore underwater volcanic caves and several interesting shipwrecks.
